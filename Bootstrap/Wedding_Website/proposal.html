									<p><b>Sam:</b> It was like any other weekend.  I headed up to Nick’s apartment in White Plains, but I still had a lot of schoolwork to do.  I was in the middle of student teaching, so I was constantly busy making lesson plans.  This was probably a good thing for Nick because I was incredibly distracted during this whole time.  On Sunday, March 1st, Nick asked if I’d like to go out to breakfast and then take a stroll outside, since it was such a nice winter day.  I agreed, but insisted that we not take too long because I needed to get back to get more work done!</p>
									
									<p><b>Nick:</b> It was a long month of deception and sneaking as I finally prepared to put my plans into motion.  I had spent the previous days picking up the ring, fretting over where to hide the ring in my apartment, and prepping for the big moment.  Sam had agreed to go out for breakfast and take a brisk walk on Sunday morning.  I was nervous.</p>
									
									<p><b>Sam:</b> So off we went to the Townhouse Diner, where we both ordered omelets and mindlessly continued our conversation.  At one point, when Nick was about to get up to pay the bill, I thought it was odd that he hesitated to leave his jacket at the table, but of course, I really did not think anything of it until now.  Little did I know at the time, he had my engagement ring in his jacket!</p>
									
									<p><b>Nick:</b> Luckily, my nerves wore off at the diner.  I was mostly worried about a potential snowstorm which was threatening to hit later that afternoon, but otherwise I knew the plan was moving along smoothly and Sam didn't seem to have any idea what was coming.  Of course, she couldn't see my hand feeling for the ring in my pocket the whole time!</p>

									<p><b>Sam:</b> After we left the Townhouse Diner, Nick took me to the Kensico Dam in Valhalla, New York.  We have been there a few times before.  It’s such a beautiful area, with the reservoir and trees on one side and a lovely park on the other.  It also has stunning views all around since it is higher up.  As we started to walk, Nick began talking about our relationship and how amazing it has been.  But, silly me did not realize what he was trying to do and kept changing the conversation to odd observations I was making around the reservoir.  I did not ignore his beautiful sentiments completely though and told him that our relationship has, and does, mean so much to me as well.</p>
									
									<p><b>Nick:</b>  As we arrived at the dam, my anxiety reappeared.  I realized that within the next hour I would finally, officially be engaged to Sam! For whatever reason, I realized that I had never planned out exactly what I would do or say when the time finally came to get down on one knee.  I also realized that I quickly would have forgotten whatever plan I had made anyway!  After countless times checking my pocket, I did know, however, that the ring was securely in place and ready for action.</p>

									<p><b>Sam:</b> We had walked the dam forward and back once.  I was ready to leave, but Nick asked if we could walk it back and forth one more time.  I agreed and at this point, noticed that Nick was not wearing his gloves.  Even though it was a beautiful day out, it was still cold, so I asked him to put his gloves on, but he refused.  We made it half way across the dam when I took off my gloves to warm his hands and at that moment, Nick turned to face me.  He said more wonderful things about us and slowly got down on one knee.  At that very moment, as Nick asked me to marry him, it started to snow.  Of course, I started to cry and nodded my head yes.</p>

									<p><b>Nick:</b> Like I mentioned before, my nerves were back!  After we completed one trip across and back the dam, I insisted on taking one more so that we would be smack in the center of the dam.  Despite my attempts to discuss our relationship and future, I noticed that she still had no idea why I was forcing her to walk in the freezing cold and why I refused to wear my gloves.  As I took the ring out of my pocket, though, her eyes grew and I knew all my efforts to keep the surprise were a success.  She said "yes!" </p>
