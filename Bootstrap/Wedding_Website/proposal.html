							<p>It was like any other weekend.  I headed up to Nick’s apartment in White Plains to spend the weekend, but I still had a lot of schoolwork to do.  I was in the middle of student teaching, so I was constantly busy making lesson plans.  This was probably a good thing for Nick because I was incredibly distracted during this whole time.  As Sunday, March 1st came around, Nick asked if I’d like to go out to breakfast and then take a stroll outside, since it was such a nice winter day.  I agreed, but insisted that we not take too long because I needed to get back to get some more work done!</p>

							<p>So off we went to the Townhouse Diner, where we both ordered omelets and mindlessly continued our conversation.  At one point, when Nick was about to get up to pay the bill, I thought it was odd that he hesitated to leave his jacket at the table, but of course, I really did not think anything of it until now.  Little did I know at the time, he had my engagement ring in his jacket!</p>
							
							<p>After we left the Townhouse Diner, Nick took me to the Kensico Dam.  We have been there a few times before.  It’s such a beautiful area, with the reservoir and trees on one side and a lovely park on the other.  It also has stunning views all around.  As we started to walk, Nick began talking about our relationship and how amazing it has been.  But, silly me, did not realize what he was trying to do and kept changing the conversation to odd observations I was making around the reservoir.  I did not ignore his beautiful sentiments completely though and told him that our relationship has and does mean so much to me as well.</p>
							
							<p>We had walked the dam forward and back once.  I was ready to leave, but Nick asked if we could walk it back and forth one more time.  I agreed and at this point, noticed that Nick was not wearing his gloves.  Even though it was a beautiful day out, it was still cold, so I asked him to put his gloves on, but he refused.  We made it half way across the dam when I took off my gloves to warm his hands and at that moment, Nick turned to face me.  He said more wonderful things about us and slowly got down on one knee.  At that very moment, as Nick asked me to marry him, it started to snow.  Of course, I started to cry and nodded my head yes.</p>
							
							<p>Little did I know that the surprise did not stop there.  When we got back to Nick’s apartment, he told me that he had arranged for his and my parents to come up and meet us. Nick had been conspiring with his father, Mike, and my father, Anthony.  They had both known Nick was going to propose to me and Nick asked if they could come up to his apartment on that Sunday to celebrate.  So if I wasn’t in enough shock, my parents and Nick’s parents were coming to the apartment.  The kicker?  I couldn’t say a word until both sets of parents were there because the mothers did not know!</p>
							
							<p>So in walked Mike and Sue.  Sue thinks that we are all going to a Westchester Knicks game later on.  While we are “waiting to go to the game,” she asks us how our day was and if we did anything special.  It was so hard to keep this secret from her!!  But we all played it cool until the buzzer rang for Nick’s apartment.  Knowing it was my parents, I just buzzed them in without asking who it was.  Sue was kind of shocked that I would do such a thing and I needed to play it off as if we do that all the time.  However, the doorbell rang and there are my parents.  My mom thought we were all getting together to go out to dinner, so she is not surprised to see Mike and Sue.  But Sue is really confused.  But everyone greets each other and begins talking like it was any other get together.  I run into Nick’s bedroom to grab my engagement ring (since I had to take it off so Sue would not see!)  It worked out perfectly that when I came back out, both my mom and Sue were sitting on the couch.  It was then, that Nick announced that he had proposed to me and I showed the moms my ring.  It took the both of them a couple of seconds to process what Nick had said and what I was showing them, but as soon as it sunk in, it was hugs, kisses, and tears all around!</p>
