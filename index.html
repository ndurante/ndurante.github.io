<h1>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h1>

<h3>I'm renovating my <a href="https://github.com/ndurante" target="_blank">github</a> to include my newer work with Bootstrap.  I hope to use this home screen to link to my various projects hosted on github.  I'm already getting plenty of practice using git from the command line (created and fixed some merge issues and didn't lose anything!)</h3>
